    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Why Do I Need to Select a Chunk Size?",
      "answer": "Chunk size refers to how many periods of data are grouped together. For example, if you are downloading facility-level monthly out-patient visits from January to December 2021, and you select the 3 as the chunk size, which means the Downloader will group 3 months together as a single request and make four requests in total to finish the download. Selecting a chunk size helps split large datasets into manageable parts, ensuring faster processing, easier downloads, and reduced risk of system overload. Always select the appropriate chunk size based on your country's DHIS2 system situations."

    "q2": {
      "question": "Why did the download fail, and how can I find out what went wrong?",
      "answer1": "The data downloader produces a log of errors. Here are some common errors with an explanation and suggestions for solutions.",
      "answer2": "Error: \"Cannot read properties of null (reading 'textContent')\"\nCause: This usually happens when the requested time periods or indicators are missing. This could mean there is no data stored in DHIS2 for a specific indicator in a specific month or time period. To troubleshoot:",
      "requirements": [
        "Make sure you’ve selected the correct time periods and data indicators before starting the download.",
        "This error won’t interrupt the data download process. When a request fails, the system will continue, and you can review any failed requests once the download is complete."
      ],
      "answer3": "Error: \"HTTP Status 500 – Internal Server Error\"\nCause: This error usually means there’s an issue with the server, often due to a disconnection. To troubleshoot:",
      "serverIssues": [
        "Ensure all required data fields (like time periods and data elements/indicators) are selected.",
        "Verify that your login credentials are correct.",
        "Check that the server is up and not experiencing any issues."
      ]
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Why do I need to change the filename even though it says the file will be replaced?",
      "answer": "The downloader splits large requests into smaller parts and then combines them into a single file. Even if it says it’s replacing an existing file with the same name, the Data Downloader actually adds new data to that file. To avoid confusion, give each new download a unique name to ensure the data is correctly added."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How can I avoid download timeouts with large data requests?",
      "answer": "Downloads have a 1-hour time limit, meaning requests that take longer than 1 hour will automatically time out. To avoid this, split your requests into smaller batches to ensure each download is completed within the time frame. Each DHIS2 system operates uniquely, with variations in data download speeds. You may need to experiment to find the optimal data volume that can be requested in a single download."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How much data can I download into an Excel file?",
      "answer": "Excel can handle around 1 million rows, so if you’re downloading large datasets (e.g., data from thousands of facilities across multiple months), you might reach Excel’s limit. To manage this, try downloading the data in smaller batches. If you exceed Excel’s capacity, you can still open the CSV file in statistical software to access the full dataset."
